                            <p  class="dt-text">We are devastated to announce the passing of our beloved Virgil Abloh, a fiercely devoted father, husband, son, brother, and friend. He is survived by his loving wife Shannon Abloh, his children Lowe Abloh and Grey Abloh, his sister Edwina Abloh, his parents Nee and Eunice Abloh, and numerous dear friends and colleagues," the post read</p>

                                <p class="dt-text">Abloh was a true multi-hyphenate -- first, and foremost a fashion designer, who before making history as Louis Vuitton's first Black artistic director, founded the cult streetwear label Off-White.
                                    At Louis Vuitton, he brought in a younger demographic, with menswear collections that blurred the lines between high fashion and streetwear, as well as pushed artistic boundaries and challenged gender norms. A sparkly "embroidered bib" he designed, for example, became an instant talking point when it was worn by Timothée Chalamet to the Golden Globes in 2019. Other versions were donned by Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman.</p>

                            <p  class="dt-text">hen Uruguayan fashion designer Gabriela Hearst was announced as the creative director of luxury fashion house Chloé in December last year, those familiar with her work knew it spelled change for the 70-year-old French brand -- especially given the maison's CEO, Riccardo Bellini, had already indicated he was looking to take the label in a new purpose-driven direction.</p>

                                    Hearst was drawn to Chloé because it has an aesthetic she understood. "It was natural to my vocabulary," she said, joking that the job had to go to her because she shares a name with the label's founder, Gaby Aghion. On a more serious note, the designer said she was motivated by the opportunity to implement the research and development she and her team at Gabriela Hearst had been carrying out over the years. Could she scale it up at the larger, more established house, she wondered? The answer appears to be: yes.</p>

Hemlines were high and midriffs were exposed as designers laid bare parts of the body that many of us have kept wrapped up in loungewear during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

                                <p class="dt-text">After months of pandemic-related disruption, more brands than ever chose to return to the physical show format and some of them went big -- no more so than the French luxury house Balmain. To celebrate creative director Olivier Rousteing's 10-year anniversary with the brand, an enormous show was staged within Paris' La Seine Musicale on a river island, in the western suburbs of the city. The two-day event was part music festival, part collection unveiling. The runway show opened with a pre-recorded audio message from Beyoncé, praising Rousteing's efforts to "to keep pushing that door open wider, making sure that others can also have opportunities for reaching their dreams" throughout his career.
                                    Meanwhile, Parisian fashion staple Saint Laurent returned to its show venue of choice, the Eiffel Tower, and Chanel sparked joy on Tuesday with an event that took the catwalk show format back to the '80s, when models would prance and twirl down the runway to the delight of shouty photographers who flanked the stage. In the show notes, the brand's creative head, Virginie Viard, wrote that she used to "love the sound of flashbulbs going off at the shows in the eighties" and she wanted to recreate that atmosphere for today.</p>

Writing to the label (whose name he can't quite pronounce: "Balun... Balloon... Baleen... Balenciaga-ga"), Homer asks for the cheapest item available with the label's name on it.</p>

                                As Britain's longest-reigning monarch, the Queen is both a cherished and consistent part of public life -- her image synonymous with stability and tradition to the British people.
                                When masses gather and wait dutifully to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty, the color she steps out in is more important than you might think, too. Standing at 5 feet 3 inches, vivid hues like yellow, fuschia, purple, chartreuse and periwinkle make her easier to spot in large crowds. The Queen's bold wardrobe is so distinctive, it has spawned entire books dedicated to recording each beaming outfit. In "Our Rainbow Queen," Welsh journalist Sali Hughes notes Her Majesty's color wheel considerations: "(she) won't wear green to grassy venues, nor dark colours against dark upholstery."</p>
                                <img src="/ShopLozodo/img/news/5.jpg" alt="" class="dt-img">
                                <p class="dt-text">There is an art to dressing one of the most photographed women in history. Over her 60 year reign the Queen has amassed an army of staffers, but few have been trusted with the task of royal dressmaker. British designers Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, Stewart Parvin and Angela Kelly have all helped develop her style -- steering clear of trend cycles that can quickly fall out of favor.
                                    Kelly -- the Queen's sartorial adviser for almost three decades and a close confidante -- has created an air-tight formula that ensures every one of the her 300 annual engagements hits the mark. From fail-safe weighted hem-lines and wager-worthy hats, to extensively researched weather forecasts and local customs -- the Queen's outfits are nothing if not judicious.</p>
